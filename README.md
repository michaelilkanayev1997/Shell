# Shell (Bash-like)
This project is a custom command shell implementation, similar to the well-known bash shell. The purpose of this assignment is to gain experience with advanced programming techniques, including process creation, termination, and overriding an existing process. The shell will utilize fundamental system calls such as fork, wait, exec, and more.

## Features:
-	pwd
-	cd
-	nano
-	cat
-	wc, wc –l, wc –c and wc –w
- cp
-	pipe
-	clear
- grep and grep -c
- ls, ls –l, ls -l > output_file
- tree
- exit
    
## How to Use:
In order to run the program in Linux, the following commands must be executed in the terminal at the location of the files:

1. Compile: gcc -o shell source.c main.c
2. Running the program: ./shell
 
Notes: The tree.c file is activated when needed from the source.c file, so there is no need to activate it.
